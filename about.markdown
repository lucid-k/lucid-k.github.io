## My Journey

My journey with computers started when I was younger than 10 years, I would go to my neighbour's house to tinker with their desktop. I learned the basics, such as navigating the file system, and installed games which my friends and I would play. That experience really helped to spark my curiosity about computers. In high school I studied computers and got the basics about computer hardware and software and at the end made an access project about a management system.  
In campus, I have studied computers at a much deeper level and it has allowed me to choose a career path as a System administrator which I am currently pursuing. I have worked as a IT support attachee. This working experience has allowed me to work on servers, LAN connections, computer hardware and peripheral devices, and installation and update of software.
