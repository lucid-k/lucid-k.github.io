# Welcome

Hello, My name is **Anthony Maiyo**. I identify as _he/him_. I am still an undergraduate at the University of Eldoret studying BSc. Computer Science. I hope to graduate at the end of the year 2025, fingers crossed. I have an interest of anything computer oriented. I find computers interesting and I am amazed at the diverse fields it can be applied.  
Through this site I hope to showcase my journey as I explore. I hope to keep adding on to the site as I progress.  
I would like to leave you with a poem by _Tecumseh_  
> So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart.  
Trouble no one about their religion;  
respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours.  
Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life.  
Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people.  
Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.  
Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place.  
Show respect to all people and grovel to none.  
When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living.  
If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself.  
Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision.  
When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way.  
Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.
